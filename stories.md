# Train Trip - Zephyr.

I boarded the Zephyr with a primary intention to binge-read as many books as possible while immersed in nature, as the train zipped across central America from San Francisco to Chicago. I had selected and ordered an eclectic collection half-a-dozen books. Six books in a span of 72 hours - a decent goal, I presumed. Following were the list of books I took:
1) Brain Greene
2) Doors of Perception.
3) Rosie Project.
4) Autobiography of a Yoga.
5) Economix
6) ---

Time dilation as a theme.

Little did I know I would be so engaged in the conversation with my fellow travel-mates that I would lose track of time. On the side I poured myself into understanding Einstein's version of time dilation. Spice that up with Alodus Huxley's writing on eating the mushroom. Clearly Time dilation seems to have been the theme.

Meeting Architects and discussing the beams of the train station in Denver, Colorado.

The librarian from Sacramento. About the selection of books based on the interests of the local people.

The Inca Archeologist.

Owen - on the multiple talks about race.

As Engineers we hardly get to interact with people from different walks of life.

Child-Abuse:

The chill construction worker.

Being fearful on the train.

The girl from the progressive "nun" group.

Third class travels dissolves class boundaries. The trick though is to make sure the trip length is long.

Train travel provides an opportunity to classless travels. By classless I mean a societal class. It is a great way to break away from our day to day bubbles and sense a pulse of people from different walks of life.

Walt Whitman wrote in him **[poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48859/song-of-the-open-road)** - "Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?"

I read those lines long after the trip and the first person who came to my thoughts was - Crystal from Sacramento. "I have dealt drugs on the street and I can take down any man".
