### Launching a GCP VM with a GPU

The Google compute platform console is a bit confusing to navigate - below are the steps to launch a preempt-able VM with a GPU.

1. As of Jan 2018, the GPU quota has to be increased under the quota page. Also you need to upgrade your account from the trial version.
2. Checkout the locations where the GPU'es are available here -  . You could choose between a preempt-able and non-preempt-able GPU. Preempt-able is basically cheaper than the regular VM/GPU with the catch that it can be preemptively be taken down if there is a high load to meet.

2. Request for an increase in quota (for an Nvidia K80) from the quota page under the compute engine page using the edit quotas. This takes while to get approved. And you have to authorize your account by paying 35 dollars. (That's steep for a account check ;))

3. A preempt-able GPU goes along with only a preempt-able VM. Under the Compute Engine section - create a VM instance with the following attributes:
   - Under the customize button - Add 1 GPU, Nvidia K80.
   - OS distribution - Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
   - Under the Management, ... SSH keys tab - change the VM to a preempt-able VM.
Once the VM is created. You should be able to SSH into it.

4. SSH into your box:

> gcloud compute --project <project-name  > ssh --zone <zone> <instance>

### Installing the Nvidia driver

1. Check if the GPU is added to the VM.
