### Launching a GCP VM with a GPU

The Google compute platform console is a bit confusing to navigate - below are the steps to launch a preempt-able VM with a GPU.

1. As of Jan 2018, the GPU quota has to be increased under the quota page. Also you need to upgrade your account from the trial version.
2. Checkout the locations where the GPU'es are available here -  . You could choose between a preempt-able and non-preempt-able GPU. Preempt-able is basically cheaper than the regular VM/GPU with the catch that it can be preemptively be taken down if there is a high load to meet.

2. Request for an increase in quota (for an Nvidia K80) from the quota page under the compute engine page using the edit quotas. This takes while to get approved. And you have to authorize your account by paying 35 dollars. (That's steep for a account check ;))

3. A preempt-able GPU goes along with only a preempt-able VM. Under the Compute Engine section - create a VM instance with the following attributes:
   - Under the customize button - Add 1 GPU, Nvidia K80.
   - OS distribution - Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
   - Under the Management, ... SSH keys tab - change the VM to a preempt-able VM.
Once the VM is created. You should be able to SSH into it.

4. SSH into your box:

> gcloud compute --project <project-name  > ssh --zone <zone> <instance>

### Installing the Nvidia driver

1. Check if the GPU is added to the VM.
> lspci | grep Nvidia
  00:04.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK210GL [Tesla K80] (rev a1)

2. Remove previously installed drivers.
> sudo apt-get purge nvidia*

3. Add the graphics Driver PPA repository.
> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers
> sudo apt-get update

4. Install the latest nvidia-driver for you card. nvidia-390 in this case.
> sudo apt-get install nvidia-390

5. Reboot your box.
> sudo reboot

6. Check if the driver is installed.
> lsmod | grep NVIDIA

If you run into issues with any of the above steps, checkout this [Reference](http://www.linuxandubuntu.com/home/how-to-install-latest-nvidia-drivers-in-linux) link.

7. Once the machine is up, check the GPU diagnostics with [nvidia-smi](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/alt-nvidia-current-smi.1.html).
