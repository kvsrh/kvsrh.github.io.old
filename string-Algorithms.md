String Alogrithms --

KMP for the basic algorithm -- 
Rabin Karp Algorithm: 
Aho-Corasick Algorithm: Finding all the occurences of a list of words in a text string.

Build a trie of the input to-match strings and we can then work on each word in the text and see if it matches any of the to-match strings. 

It turns out that Regex is fast if the number of keywords to be searched and replaced is in the 100s. But my corpus had over 20K keywords and 3 Million documents.

Regex and regular search both have different benefits. 

Suffix trees - 

-- Z algorithm from tushar roy - check the algo out. 

-- Substrings and subsequence and prefix and suffix.
